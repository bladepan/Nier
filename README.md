# Nier
Dotnet utility classes usually end up in folders named like "Utilities", "Utils" or "Commons" in various projects. This project intends to provide a set of core libraries for dotnet like [Apache Commons Lang](https://commons.apache.org) and [Guava](https://github.com/google/guava) for Java. Many classes and methods are ported from these 2 projects.
